**Demo proof of delivery**

A previous version of this app is successfully being used in production at one of our customers.

The goal of this public demo is to show other potential customers the possibilities that we offer in custom-tailored line-of-business apps.

This demo is currently available for the following platforms:

* Progressive Web App: https://dalosy-projecten-bv.github.io/demo-proof-of-delivery-pwa/#/
* Google play store: todo
* App store: todo

Sample barcodes for iOS and Android can be found here: https://github.com/dalosy-projecten-bv/demo-proof-of-delivery-pwa/blob/master/barcodes.pdf

Some highlights:
1. Built with Flutter (Which is awesome and fun!).
